﻿The Fiskmö memoq plugin is currently available as a separate plugin, which the user can install themselves. The Fiskmö memoq plugin requires that the Fiskmö MT service has been separately installed and is running on the same computer.

Installing the Fiskmö memoq plugin (memoq 8.3):
1. Download the Fiskmö MT service and extract the zip package to any local folder on the computer. Start the MT service by double-clicking the FiskmöMTService.exe file. Firewall or anti-virus software may block the execution of FiskmöMTService.exe. Usually execution wil proceed after it has been approved in the security software prompts or the security software has scanned FiskmöMTService.exe. If FiskmöMTService.exe fails to start properly, check the log file in the logs subfolder.
2. Download the Fiskmö memoq plugin (FiskmöMTPlugin.dll) and copy it to the Addins subfolder in the memoq installation folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Kilgray\memoQ-8 by default). Depending on your security settings, you may need to go to the file properties of the plugin file in the Windows Explorer and click the Unblock button in order for the plugin to work.
3. Start memoq. During startup memoq will display a dialog notifying you of an unsigned plugin. Check that the name of the plugin is Fiskmö MT plugin and accept the loading of the plugin by clicking Yes.
4. Create MT settings and enable Fiskmö MT plugin in the created settings. This can be achieved in various ways, for example in the following way: Click memoq in the memoq top menu, click Resources, click Resource Console and then click MT Settings. Click Create/use new and specify a name for the MT settings.
5. Click the MT settings that you just created and click Edit. Locate Fiskmö MT Plugin in the list and check the box next to it. Select Configure plugin.
6. Usually there's no need to change any settings in the Fiskmö MT plugin settings (unless the port number has been changed in Fiskmö MT service, which is rare). You can check that the Fiskmö MT service is running correctly by clicking Retrieve language pair information, which displays the language pairs for which MT models have been installed for in Fiskmö MT service. Just click OK to close the Fiskmö MT plugin settings window.
7. Close the MT settings window by pressing Enter.
8. Before you can use Fiskmö MT in a project for a given language pair, you must install at least one MT model for the language pair in the Fiskmö MT service application. You can either download one of the publicly available models from the Fiskmö MT repository (the Install OPUS model from Web option) or install a model from a zip file (the Install model from zip option).
9. To use Fiskmö MT in a project, select Settings in Project home tab, click the MT icon, and check the box next to the MT settings that you created previously.
10. Suggestions from the Fiskmö MT service should now be displayed by memoq for qualifying segments (i.e. those with no TM matches). Note that it might take some time for the plugin to display the translation, depending on the processing power of the computer. It may be advisable to pretranslate the document before starting work on it, so that the MT service can cache the MT for all segments before they are opened for editing. 

Troubleshooting:
1. Always make sure that Fiskmö MT service application is running when using the memoq plugin. Also make sure that an MT model has been installed for the language pair of the project. If there's a problem with communication with the service, memoq will display an error notification (Lookup error) in the bottom bar.
2. You can check the functionality of an installed MT model by selecting the model in the Fiskmö MT service application and selecting Test selected model. This opens a translation window where you can input a source sentence to be translated. You can use this window to see that the model is working correctly.
3. The Fiskmö MT service application runs several executables in the course of translation. Your antivirus program may block the execution of these executables, which may prevent the MT service from working. If the MT service fails, check your antivirus program for possible false detections.
4. The logs subfolder in the Fiskmö MT service folder contains the log for the MT service. You can find more information about possible failures by checking the log.
